/*
What is recursion ?
-> when a function calls itself until a specified condition is met.

// Stack overflow: A stack overflow in recursion occurs when a
 recursive function makes too many nested calls, exceeding the 
 call stack's capacity. Each recursive call uses some space on
 the stack to store information like function parameters,
 return addresses, and local variables. If the recursion is too deep,
 the stack can run out of space, leading to a stack overflow error.//

 // Base condition : condition which is used for stoping the stack over flow.

 // Recursion Tree :  recursion tree is a useful visual tool to understand
  and analyze the behavior of a recursive function, particularly its time 
  and space complexity. It helps in visualizing how a recursive function
  breaks down a problem into smaller subproblems and how those subproblems
  relate to each other.
  // its a method for visualising the recursion.
